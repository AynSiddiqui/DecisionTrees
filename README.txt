1. AddressOfEntryPoint
Description: This represents the entry point address where the program execution starts. For executable files, it shows the first instruction that will be executed.
Importance: Malware often modifies the entry point to inject malicious code, making this a crucial feature for detecting malware behavior. Anomalies in the entry point can indicate tampering or the presence of malicious payloads.

2. MajorLinkerVersion
Description: This indicates the version of the linker used to create the executable. The linker is responsible for combining object files into a single executable file.
Importance: Malware may use outdated or unusual linker versions compared to legitimate software. Thus, analyzing this version could help differentiate between benign and malicious binaries.

3. MajorImageVersion
Description: This is the version number of the executable image. It is typically used to indicate updates or changes to the executable.
Importance: Malware may use inconsistent or non-standard image versions to evade detection, or it may not follow versioning practices seen in legitimate software. This field can help identify binaries that don't conform to expected patterns.

4. MajorOperatingSystemVersion
Description: This specifies the major version of the operating system required to run the executable. It helps to ensure compatibility between the binary and the OS.
Importance: Malware might target specific operating system versions or use this field incorrectly to bypass certain systems. Identifying suspicious OS versions in binaries can help flag potential threats.

5. DllCharacteristics
Description: This field holds flags that describe various properties of the executable, particularly whether the file is a dynamic-link library (DLL) and other security-related attributes (e.g., whether it supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or Data Execution Prevention (DEP)).
Importance: Malware might disable certain security features or misuse these flags, making this a critical feature for distinguishing between legitimate and malicious files.

6. SizeOfStackReserve
Description: This indicates the size of the memory stack reserved by the executable.
Importance: Malware often needs to modify or allocate unusual amounts of memory for stack operations, especially when injecting code or exploiting buffer overflows. Abnormal stack sizes might indicate malicious activity.

7. NumberOfSections
Description: This represents the number of sections in the executable. Each section stores different parts of the executable (e.g., code, data, resources).
Importance: Malware often adds extra sections to binaries to store malicious payloads. Unusual or high numbers of sections could be a sign of malware attempting to hide its code or data within a binary.

8. ResourceSize
Description: This represents the size of the resources embedded in the executable (e.g., icons, images, version information).
Importance: Malware may embed or modify resources (such as replacing icons with legitimate ones) to appear more benign. Abnormally large or small resource sizes could indicate that a file has been tampered with or contains hidden payloads.
